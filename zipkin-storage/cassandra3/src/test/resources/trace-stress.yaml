### Stress test for zipkin3 traces table
###
### Stress testing is done using the `cassandra-stress` tool
###
### For example
###  cassandra-stress  user profile=trace-stress.yaml ops\(insert=1\)  duration=1m  -rate threads=4 throttle=50/s
###
### after a benchmark has been run with only writes, a mixed read-write benchmark can be run with
###  cassandra-stress  user profile=trace-stress.yaml ops\(insert=1,by_trace=1,by_trace_ts_id=1,by_annotation=1\)  duration=1m  -rate threads=4 throttle=50/s

# Keyspace Name
keyspace: zipkin3

# Table name
table: traces


### Column Distribution Specifications ###
#
# the UDT columns must be dropped before running stress

columnspec:
  - name: trace_id
    size: fixed(32)
    population: uniform(1..10k)

  - name: ts_uuid
    population: uniform(1..10k)

  - name: id
    size: fixed(32)
    population: uniform(1..10k)

  - name: ts
    size: fixed(12)
    population: uniform(1..10k)

  - name: span_name

    population: uniform(1..1k)



### Batch Ratio Distribution Specifications ###

insert:
  partitions: fixed(1)            # 1 pertition key at a time inserts to model a message being generated
  select:  fixed(1)/1000
  batchtype: UNLOGGED             # Unlogged batches
